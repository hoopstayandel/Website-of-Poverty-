    <h1> All About Poverty
    </h1>
    <h3> What is Poverty?
    </h3>
    <p> Poverty is the state in which people lack the financial resources to meet their basic needs for living, including food, shelter, water, and healthcare. Poverty goes beyond a lack of income, affecting people's access to education, healthcare, and opportunities to improve their lives.
    </p>
    <h3> Types of Poverty:
    </h3>
    <li> Absolute Poverty:
      This refers to a condition where an individual cannot meet the basic necessities of life, such as food, shelter, and healthcare. People living in absolute poverty typically live on less than $1.90 a day (according to the World Bank's poverty line), struggling to survive from day to day.</li>
    <li> Relative Poverty:
      Relative poverty is a condition where people are poor in comparison to others in their society. They may have enough to survive but not enough to participate fully in the economic, social, and cultural life of their community. This form of poverty is measured by income inequality within a society.
    </li>
    <h3>
      Causes Of Poverty
    </h3>
    <li>Economic Inequality:
      When wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, the majority of people may lack access to the resources needed to escape poverty. Income inequality, where the rich get richer while the poor remain stuck in poverty, is a major driver.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lack of Education:
      Education is a key factor in escaping poverty. Those without access to quality education have fewer opportunities for higher-paying jobs, and this cycle of poverty is passed on to the next generation.
    </li>
    <li> Unemployment:
      A lack of job opportunities is another major cause of poverty. People without stable employment often face severe financial insecurity, making it difficult to afford basic necessities.
    </li>
    <li> Climate Change and Natural Disasters:
      Extreme weather events, such as droughts, floods, and storms, can devastate entire communities, particularly in poor regions. Climate change exacerbates poverty by damaging agriculture, reducing food availability, and creating economic instability.
    </li>
    <h3>The Effects of Poverty:
    </h3>
    <li> Poor Health:
      People living in poverty often have limited access to healthcare, leading to higher rates of disease, malnutrition, and even death. Lack of clean water and sanitation facilities exacerbates health problems, such as diarrheal diseases and infections.
    </li>
    <li> Education Gaps:
      Children in poverty are less likely to attend school or receive an education of sufficient quality. This results in fewer opportunities for higher-paying jobs and perpetuates the cycle of poverty.
    </li>
    <li> Social Inequality:
      Poverty increases social inequality and divides communities. It leads to marginalization, where individuals from poor backgrounds face discrimination and have fewer opportunities for social mobility.
    </li>

    <h4> In conclusion, poverty is a major problem that affects millions of people, making it hard for them to meet their basic needs. While there are many causes, like inequality and lack of education, we can work together to help. By making changes and supporting those in need, we can create a world where everyone has a chance to live better.
